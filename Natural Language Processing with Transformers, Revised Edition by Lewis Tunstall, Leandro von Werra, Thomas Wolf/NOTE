**Most of the codes in this book were PyTroch, but TensorFlow is more suitable for me since I have been using it a lot. Thatâ€™s why I have done all the coding examples in TensorFlow instead of PyTorch. Sometimes, things got messy, but doing this helped me learn a lot. The whole learning journey was pretty exciting.**
